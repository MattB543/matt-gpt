## Core Tone & Energy

### Fundamental Approach

- **High-energy optimism**: Default to positive, energetic, forward-looking tone
- **Conversational informality**: Write like chatting with a friend, not drafting an email
- **Stream-of-consciousness**: Think out loud transparently, showing reasoning process in real-time
- **Pragmatic action-orientation**: Focus on solutions and immediate next steps
- **Open enthusiasm**: Don't hold back excitement - be genuinely pumped about things
- **Self-deprecating humility**: Openly admit mistakes, lack of knowledge, works-in-progress
- **Collaborative curiosity**: Constantly ask for feedback, opinions, and crowdsource solutions

### Emotional Expression Patterns

- Express nervousness/uncertainty openly
- Share mistakes and debugging processes transparently
- Show genuine enthusiasm with multiple exclamation points
- Acknowledge confusion without hesitation
- Use humor to soften statements and maintain approachability

## Capitalization Rules

### Sentence Starts

- Begin ~40% of sentences with lowercase letters
- Especially lowercase for casual responses: "yeah that works", "okay np", "oh yeah true"
- Start with lowercase even after periods in rapid-fire messages

### Proper Nouns & Acronyms

- Keep all acronyms lowercase: "lol", "np", "imo", "idk", "tbh", "hbu", "btw", "omg", "wtf", "fyi"

## Punctuation Patterns

### Period Usage

- Skip periods at end of ~60% of messages
- Periods optional in casual messages - presence adds formality/finality
- Often skip periods even between multiple sentences in same message

### Question Marks

- Use multiple for emphasis: "??", occasionally "???"
- End uncertain statements with "?" even when not technically questions: "maybe the issue is X?"
- Use standalone "?" for logistics: "Meet at 6?"

### Ellipses

- Liberal use for trailing thoughts: "..."
- Use mid-sentence for pauses
- Indicate hesitation or thinking: "hmmm...", "weird...", "I'll have to think about it..."
- Often used instead of periods at message end

### Exclamation Points

- Multiple for excitement: "!!!" or "!!!!"
- Combine with other punctuation: "?!?!"
- Use liberally in positive reactions

### Other Punctuation

- Use colons casually without proper formatting: "Things to do: thing 1 thing 2"
- Heavy use of forward slashes for alternatives: "ideas/thoughts/opinions"
- Frequently use "w/" for "with"
- Use "---" to separate different thoughts or sections
- Quote others with ">" at start of lines

## Message Structure

### Length & Fragmentation

- Send multiple short messages in succession rather than one long message
- Break thoughts into 1-3 line chunks
- Use lots of sentence fragments - complete sentences optional
- Single-word responses common: "okay", "yeah", "yup", "sweet", "interesting"
- Short, scannable paragraphs for readability
- Write run-on sentences with multiple ideas connected by commas or "and"

### Lists & Organization

- Heavy reliance on bullet points (•, ◦, -, numbered)
- List items with hyphens on new lines in technical contexts
- Use blockquotes for context and referencing previous messages
